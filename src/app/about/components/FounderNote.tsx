        My Journey: From Classroom to Innovation
      </p>
      <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
        My professional journey began in the most fundamental place of learning - the classroom. For three transformative years, I served as a school teacher, where I witnessed firsthand the daily struggles and triumphs of educators working tirelessly to inspire their students. This frontline experience revealed the gaps between educational aspirations and the reality of available tools and resources.
        <br /><br />
        These classroom insights ignited a passion that would reshape my career trajectory. Recognizing the immense potential of technology to revolutionize education, I made a pivotal transition into EdTech sector. Over the subsequent seven years, I had the privilege of collaborating with some of the industry&apos;s most innovative and influential edtech companies, gaining invaluable insights into how technology can truly serve education.
        <br /><br />
        This decade-long journey has equipped me with a unique, multifaceted perspective that spans the entire educational ecosystem. From my foundational teaching experience to roles in content management, QA, and project management, I&apos;ve developed a comprehensive understanding of both the pedagogical principles that drive effective learning and the technological capabilities that can enhance it.

      <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
        Drawing from this rich tapestry of experiences - and fueled by my dual passion for education and technology, complemented by a strong analytical background - I embarked on creating Instaku. This isn&apos;t just another edtech tool; I will keep improvising it with a genuine ground reality understanding of what both educators and learners truly need in today&apos;s dynamic learning environment.
